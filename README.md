# Presentables

A Angular app with a NodeJS/Express backend, for creating tables consisting of (mostly) numbers, whereafter they can be stored and edited if needed. The app uses MongoDB for storing users and node-json-db for storing the tables, although this could also be achieved by using MongoDB. The passwords and data the tables are stored encrypted.

This particular repository shows the PresenTable app as served by the backend itself (no SSR though), for web use.
